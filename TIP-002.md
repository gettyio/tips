## Tron Improvement Proposal - 002
## Preamble

```
TIP: 0002
Title: Tron Request for Comments - TRC20 Token Proposal
Author: getty.io
Created: 2018-08-17
```

## Abstract
A standard interface for tokens in Tron Network. The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.

## Motivation
Currently it's not possible to exchange tokens inside TRON Network. However the industry standards ERC20 have been developed. Our proposal is to taken advantage of the open source standard ERC20 and create a new TRC20 standard for TRON. An interface that allows any tokens on TRON to be re-used and exchanged by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token

### Implementation
#### Interface Proposal
```js
pragma solidity ^0.4.23;

/*
    TRC20 Standard Token interface
*/
contract ITRC20Token {
    // these functions aren't abstract since the compiler emits automatically generated getter functions as external
    function name() public view returns (string) {}
    function symbol() public view returns (string) {}
    function decimals() public view returns (uint8) {}
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256) {}
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256) { _owner; }
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256) { _owner; _spender; }

    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);
}

```

#### Implementation Proposal
```js
pragma solidity ^0.4.23;
import './interfaces/ITRC20Token.sol';
import '../utility/Utils.sol';

/**
    TRC20 Standard Token implementation
*/
contract TRC20Token is ITRC20Token, Utils {
    string public standard = 'Token 0.1';
    string public name = '';
    string public symbol = '';
    uint8 public decimals = 0;
    uint256 public totalSupply = 0;
    mapping (address => uint256) public balanceOf;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint256)) public allowance;

    event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);
    event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value);

    /**
        @dev constructor

        @param _name        token name
        @param _symbol      token symbol
        @param _decimals    decimal points, for display purposes
    */
    constructor(string _name, string _symbol, uint8 _decimals) public {
        require(bytes(_name).length > 0 && bytes(_symbol).length > 0); // validate input

        name = _name;
        symbol = _symbol;
        decimals = _decimals;
    }

    /**
        @dev send coins
        throws on any error rather then return a false flag to minimize user errors

        @param _to      target address
        @param _value   transfer amount

        @return true if the transfer was successful, false if it wasn't
    */
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value)
        public
        validAddress(_to)
        returns (bool success)
    {
        balanceOf[msg.sender] = safeSub(balanceOf[msg.sender], _value);
        balanceOf[_to] = safeAdd(balanceOf[_to], _value);
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
        return true;
    }

    /**
        @dev an account/contract attempts to get the coins
        throws on any error rather then return a false flag to minimize user errors

        @param _from    source address
        @param _to      target address
        @param _value   transfer amount

        @return true if the transfer was successful, false if it wasn't
    */
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value)
        public
        validAddress(_from)
        validAddress(_to)
        returns (bool success)
    {
        allowance[_from][msg.sender] = safeSub(allowance[_from][msg.sender], _value);
        balanceOf[_from] = safeSub(balanceOf[_from], _value);
        balanceOf[_to] = safeAdd(balanceOf[_to], _value);
        emit Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
        return true;
    }

    /**
        @dev allow another account/contract to spend some tokens on your behalf
        throws on any error rather then return a false flag to minimize user errors

        also, to minimize the risk of the approve/transferFrom attack vector
        (see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/), approve has to be called twice
        in 2 separate transactions - once to change the allowance to 0 and secondly to change it to the new allowance value

        @param _spender approved address
        @param _value   allowance amount

        @return true if the approval was successful, false if it wasn't
    */
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)
        public
        validAddress(_spender)
        returns (bool success)
    {
        // if the allowance isn't 0, it can only be updated to 0 to prevent an allowance change immediately after withdrawal
        require(_value == 0 || allowance[msg.sender][_spender] == 0);

        allowance[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
        emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
        return true;
    }
}
```



### Methods

**NOTE**: Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() view returns (string name)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() view returns (string symbol)
```


#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() view returns (uint8 decimals)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() view returns (uint256 totalSupply)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the `_from` account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) view returns (uint256 remaining)
```


### Events
#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```

#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```
